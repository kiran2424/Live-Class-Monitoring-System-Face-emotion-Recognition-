# Live-Class-Monitoring-System-Face-emotion-Recognition
Abstract:

The Indian education landscape has been undergoing rapid changes for the past 10 years owing to the advancement of web-based learning services, specifically, eLearning platforms.

Global E-learning is estimated to witness an 8X over the next 5 years to reach USD 2B in 2021. Although the market is growing on a rapid scale, there are major challenges associated with digital learning when compared with classrooms. One of many challenges is how to ensure quality learning for students. Digital platforms might overpower physical classrooms in terms of content quality but when it comes to understanding whether students are able to grasp the content in a live class scenario is yet an open-end challenge.

In a physical classroom during a lecturing teacher can see the faces and assess the emotion of the class and tune their lecture accordingly, whether he is going fast or slow. While digital platforms have limitations in terms of physical surveillance but it comes with the power of data and machines which can work for you. Deep learning backed system not only solves the surveillance issue, but it also removes the human bias from the system, and all information is no longer in the teacherâ€™s brain rather translated in numbers that can be analysed and tracked.

Problem Statement:

Our objective is to solve the mentioned challenge by applying deep learning algorithms to live video data in order to recognize the facial emotions and categorize them accordingly.

Data used:

We have utilized the FER 2013 dataset provided on Kaggle. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral).


Steps involved:

A) Import Libraries
B) Importing Data
C) Data Visualisation
D) Data Pre-processing 
i) Normalization of Data
ii) Splitting the Data
E) Applying CNN Model
F) Model Deployment
